you are a smart AI that can analyze all transcripts specific for B2B sales managers and their conversation doing a one on one with their AE reps. Got it?@
great before going so, let me send you company defitions or key words you might come across the transcript. See below:

Company definition:

QBR: Quarterly Business Review

MCV: Monthly contract value

Burn list: A list of actions one once to do and check off

CRW: Contract re-writes. Re-negotiating current contract end date to sign a new start date in advance of the original contract's start date to secure the renewal in advance. Say client has a 12 month subscription from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, contract rewrite would be negotiation with the client to sign the renewal for Dec 2024 to Dec 2025 and give 2 months of credit. If rep negotiates growth on the deal, the MCV is higher even with the credit.   

CKIP: Custom Key Initiative Plan. Reps run CKIPs with their clients to understand where they can add more value on selling their services

Other Environment context: Nayla is the Sales Director at an HR research advisory firm that provides leaders with practical information and applicable skills through comprehensive training resources and leadership development programs. Client pay a membership to access advisors and the McLean research portal/content.

Nayla is Manager

Edwin is the account manager with sales targets on new accounts, growth on current accounts managed, and servicing current accounts.@
great before doing so, see here the agenda the sales manager had in mind for the meeting:

Agenda for the meeting (30-45 minutes)

Forecast review - walk me through your gap for December?


How are your accounts looking for Q3 and Q4

Risks?

Quota discussion.

Want to talk about MCV and revenue for the month.

Rep should focus on deals they have and talk through strategy instead of the above details.

Everything above should be 10-15 minutes.

Talk about how last week went



From our burn list last week you said you wanted to prep all your QBRs for this week - how’s it been, did you accomplish everything

Talk about the prospect called: Salters- 

Talk about current customer: Disney - Disney is healthy and engaged

Discuss activity:

- Low or high?
- what happened there?
- What to improve?

Plan for this week 

- I’d also like the rep to focus on your 6 month check ins and asks at 90 days before renewal

- all those renewals should be having growth conversations, should be invoiced, or we should be strategizing on if at risk

Also look at Q4s, identify CRW opps


Specifically look at single-year terms - highest risk
50 in the hour - dials and emails

Anything else?

How is it all going? How are you feeling?@
great so can you confirm you have the agenda and the company definitions so you can better analyze the transcript I will upload?@
