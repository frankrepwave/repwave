Edwin Saraccini: Okay, I think this is working now. Yeah, no, I'm doing good. I'm busy,…
Nayla: but
Edwin Saraccini: busy week obviously, but I'm pretty happy that year end for some companies are around the corner and ready to Get some of the last minute budget. So other than that in Hollywood,…
Nayla: Yeah. Cool.
Edwin Saraccini: I mean so it's gonna be fine.
Nayla: Yeah, speaking end of your budget. I know we talked about that last week and we talked about just getting plans in places for some of your q3s and Q4. So why don't we start there walk me through your forecast, especially looking at your gap for December want to make sure we have a good plan in mind. So what did you pull together just in terms of forecast for the month?
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, I think I have a here. I'm just going to share my screen.
Edwin Saraccini: I'm just going to share my screen here. So.
Edwin Saraccini: Are you able to see this? Yeah, so I have two big deals in my forecast.
Nayla: Yeah.
Edwin Saraccini: I think that the closely wrong I kind of put that as a proxy in there right now, but the two big ones in Pokémon is Disney and soldiers of the two big ones. That I'm working on it.
Nayla: Okay, and then when do those renew?
Edwin Saraccini: I think I'm pretty sure. Disney is in March.
Edwin Saraccini: So I could change that to March.
Nayla: So one thing I want you to come prepped with Edwin was basically take a look at your December what Revenue can we bring in for mber? Specifically then we'll look at your q3s and q4s and come up with a plan for those ones. So are you planning to rewrite them into December or is there a reason we have them piped for December?
Edwin Saraccini: I'm no not really I kind of just had as a placeholder for what I thought I know that I think they're both up for renewal in March. And so I kind of had that place award in December, but I was able to change that right now and I'm more confident for a March close, but these are the two biggest deals and my pipeline I'm working on.
Nayla: So, appreciate you putting this together. I do want you to take it back. We'll put some time on the calendar for Friday just 15 minutes follow the template that I gave you and just kind of go through your accounts to look sold yet. What revenue is coming in for December instead of looking at? what can we invoice early? Because that's what it looks like. I'm also seeing Salters.
Nayla: Actually, the Disney one. from what I have in my notes, they're actually up for renewal in July. Do you have the same thing as me?
Edwin Saraccini: I think check the notes I thought that they were doing March but I could double check that. Yeah.
Nayla: So I can say with certainty. It's So why don't we shift that out to July and I actually do want to kind of focus on that one because there's 75k a perennial in Q4, which if that doesn't come through it is a single year term as I'm sure you have in your notes as well. So if that doesn't come through we're gonna have a massive hole end of year. So we're gonna have to have a pretty strong strategy in place to either rewrite them into earlier in the year or we're approaching that the six-month Mark for their renewal. So we need to be asking what their plan is to renew. So do you I know we talked about your dials were relatively low. We're on Monday, but you said you wanted to kind of come up with a plan for more of your risk accounts. Can you talk me through what did you think up for Disney so far?
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, sorry, I don't have that really clear. are you asking about my plan with Disney particular or might just general activity?
Nayla: your plan with Disney, so the expectation from last week was that you'd have a list of your risk accounts and would have a high level plan that we could talk about in our one-on-one. So for Disney specifically we'll start with them because they are one of your higher accounts. What's your plan to kind of tackle that sooner than later and make sure that we mitigate risks now then
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, the way I have Disney they're pretty healthy. They're really engaged we had a couple qbr's in place and we've done some reviews and they seem pretty optimistic that they're gonna renew with us. I'm not really worried about that one too much. It is like
Nayla: a quick question, Eddie Did they say they're going to renew did we straight up ask or? What makes you feel like they will renew?
00:05:00
Edwin Saraccini: 
Edwin Saraccini: I didn't know I didn't get a convertible confirmation yet. But they seem pretty healthy like using us and they seem to have no issues and complaints on are you utilization? So kind of confident we could invoice them but I guess I should ask them or I can ask them or…
Nayla: So I'm taking a look like you're right.
Edwin Saraccini: push for that.
Nayla: They do look pretty healthy. They're using the advisory calls. Our qbr is coming up for this or looks like next week. The thing I'm worried about is on gain site. They're in the green for the most part. The only thing they're in the red for is Diagnostics. So have we been having conversations about getting them on diagnostics a bit more? Because we know those are stickier like that that would hopefully mitigate some risk there too, or what does that look like so far?
Edwin Saraccini: 
Edwin Saraccini: I'd have to check my notes again,…
Nayla: If okay,…
Edwin Saraccini: but I'm pretty sure like They mentioned some interest in other aspects. I feel are called via opportunity. I could bring it up to them I guess.
Nayla: I'm gonna challenge you to get solid answers from them part of it is just better probing going into the qbr.
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah.
Nayla: What are you planning to ask and a lot of it is what do you want the end goal to be so if you don't have strong answers if they will renew or not, then we could probably consider A miss so we need to kind of make sure that next touch point. We have clear next steps on what the renewal could look like and we're planning seats for growth. So I know you wanted to get a deck together for that qbr conversation coming up. Did you have a chance to put that together? for us to review today or
Edwin Saraccini: on no, I didn't put it together just yet, but I'm definitely thinking of Because I thought Disney would be done. I thought it was a 75,000 deal and doing March so I was gonna make A talk align myself with our strategy team on our service offering what else can we sell to them and then build a deck afterwards after that call?
Nayla: So if I'm a client and we jump in that qbr call, what's your agenda?
Edwin Saraccini: what I think my agenda would be I would want to understand with Disney. What's the hardly liking her current service? What's their overall? strategy. what we think there's an opportunity on and sell are we good for our basic renewal for coming July or I guess more importantly are they interested for upsell and more of our services? So really try to hear that sales motion going I'm thinking.
Nayla: Okay, it's a good approach. I do want to obviously try to pull it back to contract rewrite. So why don't we book 15 minutes for tomorrow to build out a plan for that if we can align them to their fiscal year in January. It actually makes a lot of sense. Is there fiscal year January? Can you confirm and So let's come in with a bit of a more solid proposal for them.
Edwin Saraccini: I think so. Yeah.
Nayla: To be future-focused and…
Edwin Saraccini: Okay.
Nayla: and just a little bit more assumptive while also asking if they intend to renew so let's put time aside. In terms of your prep for that. If you could pull together your deck just make sure that it's as put together as possible get the agenda in place. We need to be building out an optimal membership as well. So just have some of those slides in place and we'll kind of come up with a plan together on that one. So
Nayla: we're running out of time. So I'm going to skip to a couple more here.
Edwin Saraccini: I did want to talk about Salters like that.
Nayla: Yeah.
Edwin Saraccini: That's a deal I'm pretty confident that's gonna come in March and I'm pretty sure they're just do their 10% yearly increase for that contract. So it's gonna be 45 plus 10% so about dollars
Nayla: And are they on a multi-year?
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah.
Nayla: So I'm actually looking at their contract now. I had this one flagged because they're in your two of two which yet. You're right. We're invoicing in March. They're increases actually going from 45 to 58k and there's an out clause. Did you know about that?
Edwin Saraccini: No, I didn't know about clause for Salters.
Nayla: Okay, so Edwin want to make sure we know our accounts inside and out. We can't be dropping the ball on this because all of a sudden this has a massive red flag because if they are aware of their out clause and they intend to not renew then we are in the hole. So we need to really get ahead of this one. So for them, do we have a call coming up?
00:10:00
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, I think that we have a qbr call set up also.
Nayla: Can you confirm is it what date is it?
Edwin Saraccini: I think it's in January.
Nayla: Okay, when is their fiscal year begin?
Edwin Saraccini: I think it's December 31st. Did you actually go to check that?
Nayla: that's what I have. Have you pitched them a contract rewriter. I've talked about any growth Ops with them yet.
Edwin Saraccini: I'm not really I thought that your service pretty Okay, and it just be a two or two standard rewrite but definitely wasn't aware that they could opt out so I should probably put more effort there.
Nayla: Yeah, so building on the training from last week. I really want you to go back to just some of those tactics and in terms of Positioning the contract we write as an option. They're pretty ideal for that situation, especially because they're fiscal starts in January. We can kind of say a lot of our clients line up their memberships to fall in line with their fiscal year. I guess are you comfortable positioning the contract rewrite What would you like?
Edwin Saraccini: not really. I'm gonna struggle a bit with I feel like it's pushy to tell a client that let's just sign you early to match your fiscal year without I don't know what I'm giving back essentially just for us to close it earlier, so I kind of struggle with that but
Nayla: So, I mean we talked about this it's not pushy really. you really just have to understand what is in it for them. if you had to reiterate what does the client get from a contract rewrite?
Edwin Saraccini: I guess to your point they get a membership that literally match with their fiscal year-end at Smooths out there like strategy goals and matches with their fiscal plans, I guess is how I would pitch it.
Nayla: Yeah, that plus to me. It looks like they could benefit from a counselor seat. So if we go in with a Sam pitching the counselor see If we realign it with their fiscal year, there's the benefit that you just mentioned it's aligned they could have a neat and tidy contract that aligns with their fiscal on top of that whatever growth we're pitching starts immediately. So the counselor for instance they would get that access right off the bat so they don't have to wait till March when they're contract is up for Renewal. They would get it immediately and that extra spend would be offset a little bit by the credit that they'd be receiving. So this is the type of stuff I want you to be thinking about is what's in it for the client and why is it to me? When it comes to improvised it important to you in your book do you understand that side of it?
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, it's my target my Gap like I have to own it. Yeah.
Nayla: It's also risk mitigation. right we don't want to have a contract that has an out clause and…
Edwin Saraccini: right, right.
Nayla: we're waiting until
Nayla: A couple months before to deal with it.
Edwin Saraccini: then you mark
Nayla: We want to get ahead of it. So we want growth we want risk mitigation all of that stuff like the strategies. We got to build them now and really execute on it. And this is some of the stuff that We might be too late to the plate when it comes to this one. So I know we have our call.
Edwin Saraccini: first Walters for shelters
Nayla: Yeah for Salters. I know we have our call coming up in January if we're gonna be pitching a contract where you write to start in January. We need to have that call. as soon as possible, so
Edwin Saraccini: Yep, on I'll put that in my action items to try to book a call with them next week to accelerate that discussion.
Nayla: Please add me on that if possible. I'll clear my schedule. That one's gonna be a big one for us to get right so I know last week you sent me a list of tasks that you wanted to make sure you got through. How did that go?
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, I'm okay. I think I did a decent job like hitting my qbr targets terms of meetings with clients. And yeah, I guess Top Line Focus was like I wanted to up my Outreach. I did slow down a bit a couple days because I took some time off but I do plan on picking that up this week.
Nayla: Okay.
Edwin Saraccini: Or next week as yeah.
Nayla: And how did your qbr prep go and how did those calls go?
Edwin Saraccini: Fine, I do struggle sometimes take a lot of time to put these qbr together. And I'm trying to find a system to do it faster with some of my clients. So it's fine. I guess it just takes a lot of time to do it.
Nayla: So for that how are you currently prepping?
00:15:00
Edwin Saraccini: I kind of just go based off the last qbr and make edits based off our conversations that we had during that last qbr what they're trying to do and what kind of work we're doing from that advisors perspective and…
Nayla: from
Edwin Saraccini: then just update the qbr deck from those conversations.
Nayla: Okay, so if you were to go into Salesforce. you can actually generate a brand new qbr based on a different time period
Nayla: we can go over that together and…
Edwin Saraccini: I didn't know that.
Nayla: it's gonna save you a lot more time than trying to pull up all your notes because it's automatically going to populate with everything that they've done in that time period so that's probably one of the reasons it's taking a bit longer these shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes to fill out and verify so let's make sure we spend some time to go that process lean on the team.
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah.
Nayla: Erica does a really good job at this. So make sure you tap her on the shoulder maybe even book time with her after this call just to how to pull the qbr's that will do a lot for your workflow in terms of just some of the Outreach stuff. I know you had a target of reaching 80 dials every day and kind of averaging that throughout the week. I know this for the three days you were actually here you only hit 20, so Not looking great.
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah.
Nayla: Tell me a little bit about what happened even very you.
Edwin Saraccini: yeah, like I said, it took a lot of time to do the admin work, like the qbr's I wasn't aware that feature that we have on Salesforce definitely need to get around that and then just really setting up my pipeline for Outreach and research that took a long time. I'm learning a new software like Dungeon Bradley, so it just I think was just a lot of admin time that I just kind of. Spend a lot of time on and got lost in it.
Nayla: Okay, and when you are building out for instance your research for your Outreach how much time do you have dedicated to that?
Edwin Saraccini: I probably try to spend 30 minutes to an hour block off.
Nayla: so the expectation is you're hitting that Outreach I'm fine. To be honest. If you hit 60 doesn't have to be the full 80. I care more about the actual meetings being booked. So if you're putting more if you're getting higher quality less quantity, that's fine by me. The thing is all of that is just the expectation of the role. So you got to make sure we're time blocking effectively and really running your book like your own business because if we're spending too much time on the admin stuff. We're just gonna. Not have enough pipeline come January. So definitely something I want to make sure we're working on. I guess just looking at what didn't work last week when it comes to the Outreach because especially just with the focus on Pipeline build. What's your plan for this upcoming week specific Outreach?
Edwin Saraccini: So I think I'm done with my strategy and analyzing the accounts next week. I'm really just focusing on blocking off time in the morning just focus on doing dials and some emails Outreach to based off the list I have here. So I'm hoping I can hit 50 60 on average daily and get there this week.
Nayla: Okay, and what specific numbers do you want to hit in your morning block? that I can hold you accountable to that you could kind of make a goal for yourself, too.
Edwin Saraccini: 
Edwin Saraccini: if I could do a 50 in the hour I guess 50 emails or any contacts or a mix of dials and emails. I'll be pretty happy with that. So I guess to be more realistic because I'm blocking off three hours for outreach by 11 am I should have at least 40 the very least.
Nayla: Okay, so I'm gonna challenge you a little bit more especially because we should be operating at 80 dials a day if we're only hitting 40 we're lagging a little bit. So push yourself to reach a higher number. what do you think is reasonable as a stretch Target?
Edwin Saraccini: for from 9 to 11, it's only two hours, right so I can't just dial every minute and then maybe someone picks up in conversation. So
Nayla: one why not?
Edwin Saraccini: like I'm sorry.
Edwin Saraccini: cuz there's only 120 minutes and two hours, right? So a call takes five minutes when they pick up in conversation, so I think the max I could do in two hours is probably 50 Outreach.
Nayla: In two hours, so okay.
00:20:00
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah.
Nayla: That's fair. So if you're doing 50 Outreach in the morning, let's book another block for the afternoon. because That would give you two prospecting blocks start of the day end of the day.
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.
Nayla: And then the middle of the day of plenty of time to do the prep for it. And that way I mean if you get 50 in the morning 50 in the evening or afternoon, then you have a hundred. So if you Miss that a bit you land an 80. So let's make that a goal then if you can get 50 in an…
Edwin Saraccini: Okay.
Nayla: let's book an hour top of the morning. and then an hour in the evening and If anything gets in your way, let me know. I just want to make sure that we're filling your pipeline because that's what's gonna lead you to success on the month and especially heading into 2024. So does that sound good? We'll do 15 morning 50 evening. Aim, for every day again. It could be a mix of service. So it doesn't have to be pure prospecting.
Edwin Saraccini: That makes sense.
Nayla: Anything else that you want to focus on for this week we talked about just some of the strategizing for Salters and Disney. So definitely have those ones top of mind. I want to make sure Disney is a really big Focus. let's make sure that that kind of starts tomorrow. We'll have that. What did we say? 15 minute touch point?
Edwin Saraccini: Yep.
Nayla: So in order for that call to be effective, if you could come like I said with your deck prepped think through an agenda we could talk through it and kind of finesse it tomorrow, but think through what you want to accomplish and then we'll just work backwards to make sure we have a strong plan. So that one will prioritize shelters. Like I said, we'll prioritize.
Nayla: I'd also like you to take a look at your renewals that are six months out and just let's think through high level strategies for those accounts and make sure that we have qbr's book add that to your list just to make sure we have calls booked for all of those and then we could start talking about strategy. When a personal development front.
Edwin Saraccini: Yep.
Nayla: I know that's something that you said at the top of the month that you want to make sure you spend some time around. How is that been going and what do you need me to help you with this?
Edwin Saraccini: Yeah, I think I just want more opportunities to be a leader. I guess I really want to gun for leadership this year. So the best thing to help out I guess if you could help me out with any opportunities to Step Up help me identify those kind of moments or how do you recommend as you go about it to really show leadership that I'm ready for the next step?
Nayla: Yeah, I mean, I think it starts Stepping up a bit more in the team meetings. So just participating more being present. I noticed you don't always have your camera on let's just make sure Cameron's on we're smiling. We're participating and contributing that is one of the biggest ways to kind of step up as a leader and it won't take a massive lift from you. So I think that's a really good low-hanging fruit item. If you wanted to take a scrum per week lead it come with some content. It could be on anything run it by me the day before we could start doing that and maybe you take each Thursday and kind of come with a separate topic. That could be a good opportunity.
Edwin Saraccini: Okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah, I'll try to step it up then next week for some of these out opportunities.
Nayla: Okay, so why don't you come up with a plan for the upcoming month?
Edwin Saraccini: That's right.
Nayla: Then We'll start something we can fine-tune and stuff. But looking at the next four Thursdays come up with a plan. Just how you want to use each of those scrums pretty much 10 minutes by the time we Chit Chat and stuff come up with a topic that you'd like to run for the next four weeks. And then I think that could be a really good starting point for you, especially as you want to kind of step up and be in front of the group and be seen as a leader. So let's add to the list for this week under development.
Edwin Saraccini: cool
Edwin Saraccini: Cool, perfect.
Nayla: Is there anything else that you want to talk about that we didn't get to?
Edwin Saraccini: No, I guess the last little bit you have to admit my apartment performance. that was a little low was like I did struggle with personal issues at home. my mother's sick. Some folks are just not doing well. So it did take a little mental. Hold on me. so that's probably also I just want to feel like I should let
Nayla: Okay, I'm really sorry to hear about that. If you need time, please take it. There's the assistance program through work. It's really great. I used it a couple times definitely reach out to them. if there's anything I could do to just take some of that burden off of you. Just let me know and I'm happy to jump in wherever you need me to be but Still looking at all like the work stuff.
00:25:00
Edwin Saraccini: Appreciate prepare now.
Nayla: Are you stressed out about any accounts? how you feeling about the workload even on the week and stuff like that?
Edwin Saraccini: No, I think it's just a guy just trying to be more efficient doing my qbr's faster get better start pitching more and start Doing more execution, I guess so it's something I'm aware that I'm trying to work on and I hope I can get the ground running this coming week.
Nayla: Awesome, Eddie, so if you could send me a quick summary actually of the plan for this upcoming week your plan for the accounts that we talked about. then I said just from a personal front if you do need additional time, or you want to talk through anything, please let me know lean on the team lean on some of the other leaders as well and I just want to make sure that you're feeling 100% when you are here. Cool, so we'll cap it there you and I will connect tomorrow then and I'll look forward to seeing your burn list for the week. Great. Have a good one.
Edwin Saraccini: Sounds good. Thank you. Bye.
